					<p><strong>4.</strong></p>
					<p>Charges on Your Billing Account.</p>
					<p>
						(a) General. United TeleDoc bills you through an online account (your “Billing Account”) for use by your Billing Account of the Service and Provider services. You agree to pay United TeleDoc all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service and Provider services by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize United TeleDoc to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”) for the fees and costs accrued by your Billing Account for the Service and Provider services. All charges are non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. United TeleDoc reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. If United TeleDoc changes the charges for the Service and Provider services available through the Service, including by adding additional fees, United TeleDoc will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, United TeleDoc may discontinue providing the Service to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						(b) Current Information Required. You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your Billing Account. You must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify United TeleDoc if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft).
					</p>
					<p>
						(c) Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method (the “Payment Method Provider”). If United TeleDoc does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand. If you pay any fees with a credit card, United TeleDoc may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.
					</p>
					<p>
						(d) Monthly Membership Fee. You may sign up to a subscription (“Subscription”) whereby United TeleDoc may charge a monthly membership fee (the “Monthly Membership Fee”) for access to certain features of the Service. The Monthly Membership Fee may be modified by notice in accordance with this Agreement. You may have access to the Service through your employers, professional affiliations, or other organizations, and as a result, the Monthly Membership Fee may not apply to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						(e) The Monthly Membership Fee covers costs associated with the Subscription, such as the personal services and tools that enhance your healthcare experience on the Service.&nbsp; Such fees are typically not covered by insurance or other health benefits. The services and tools you receive through the Subscription include higher-touch personal services such as insurance and billing navigation, advice on provider selection, specialist booking and referral management, digital tools for easy access to United TeleDoc services and doctors, as well as lifestyle and wellness offerings. PAYMENT OF THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE TO UNITED TELEDOC IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO RECEIVE PROVIDER SERVICES ON THE SERVICE. There are options for accessing Provider services on the Service without the Subscription and payment of this fee. To learn more about the Monthly Membership Fee contact us at&nbsp;info@United TeleDoc.com.
					</p>
					<p>
						(f) You are responsible for paying the Monthly Membership Fee when you sign up for the Subscription. The Monthly Membership Fee is likely not a covered benefit under health insurance plans or other healthcare benefit plans such as the Health Saving Account or Flexible Spending Account. As a result, you acknowledge that you may not be able to submit the Monthly Membership Fee for coverage under your insurance or benefit plan, and as such, you are obligated to pay the Monthly Membership Fee.
					</p>
					<p>
						(g) For your Subscriptions, United TeleDoc will charge your Monthly Membership Fee to your designated billing account. You agree to make the payment using your chosen payment method. IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS SUBJECT TO THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE, YOU AUTHORIZE United TeleDoc TO CHARGE YOUR CHOSEN PAYMENT METHOD THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL PAYMENT AND AS A RECURRING CHARGE FOR EACH MONTHLY RENEWAL ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS, UNTIL YOU CANCEL. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP BEFORE IT RENEWS TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE FOR THE NEXT MONTH. YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING United TeleDoc AT&nbsp;INFO@UNITEDTELEDOC.COM.&nbsp;IF YOU CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TERM HAS NOT EXPIRED, YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICES UNTIL THE END OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT MEMBERSHIP TERM AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP WILL NOT BE RENEWED AFTER YOUR THEN-CURRENT TERM EXPIRES. HOWEVER, YOU WON’T BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRORATED REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT MEMBERSHIP PERIOD. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take several business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.
					</p>
					<p>
						(h) If the amount to be charged to you varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), for example, due to an increase in the Monthly Membership Fee, you have the right to receive, and we will provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 30 days before the scheduled date of the transaction. If you do not agree with the new amount in the notice, you may cancel the transaction by contacting United TeleDoc at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@UnitedTeleDoc.com">info@UnitedTeleDoc.com</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(i) ANY FREE TRIAL OR OTHER PROMOTION THAT PROVIDES PAID MEMBER-LEVEL ACCESS TO THE SERVICES MUST BE USED WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIME OF THE TRIAL. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE YOUR MEMBERSHIP, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR TRIAL MEMBERSHIP BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP FEE, AS APPLICABLE. IF YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD AND ARE INADVERTENTLY CHARGED FOR A MEMBERSHIP, PLEASE CONTACT United TeleDoc AT&nbsp;INFO@UNITEDTELEDOC.COM&nbsp;FOR A REFUND.

					<p>Arbitration of Disputes.</p>
					<p>
						(a) It is understood that any dispute between you and the United TeleDoc Group as to medical malpractice, that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this Agreement were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently, or incompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by Florida law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as Florida law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Both parties to this contract, by entering into it, are giving up their constitutional right to have such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of arbitration.
					</p>
					<p>
						(b) You understand and agree that this agreement to arbitrate binds you and anyone else (including, without limitation, a spouse or heirs and any children, whether born or unborn at the time of the occurrence giving rise to any claim) who may have a claim arising out of or related to all treatment or services provided by the United TeleDoc Group, Providers, and others employed or engaged by United TeleDoc. This includes, but is not limited to, all claims for monetary damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court, including, without limitation, suits for loss of consortium, wrongful death, emotional distress, or punitive damages. You further understand and agree that if you sign this Agreement on behalf of some other person for whom you have responsibility, then, in addition to myself, such person(s) will also be bound by this agreement to arbitrate, along with anyone else who may have a claim arising out of the treatment or services rendered to that person. You also understand and agree that this agreement to arbitrate relates to claims against any of the United TeleDoc Group, Providers, &nbsp;or others employed or engaged by the United TeleDoc Group and any consenting substitute physician, as well as a physician’s partners, associates, association, corporation or partnership, and the employees, agents, and estates of any of them. You also hereby consent to the intervention or joinder in the arbitration proceeding of all parties relevant to a full and complete settlement of any dispute arbitrated under this Agreement, as set forth in the Medical Arbitration Rules of the Florida Medical Associations and the Florida Hospital Associations (the “Rules”).
					</p>
					<p>
						(c) You agree that the arbitrators have the same immunity from civil liability as that of a judicial officer when acting in the capacity of arbitrator under this agreement to arbitrate. This immunity shall supplement, not supplant, any other applicable statutory or common law.
					</p>
					<p>
						(d) YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES OF UNITED TELEDOC OR ITS EMPLOYED OR ENGAGED PROVIDERS, AND THAT IF YOU DO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CHANGE YOUR MIND WITHIN 30 DAYS OF TODAY, THEN YOU MAY CANCEL THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BY GIVING WRITTEN NOTICE TO UNITED TELEDOC WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE OF YOUR SIGNATURE BELOW STATING THAT YOU WANT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

						(e) On behalf of yourself and all others bound by this agreement to arbitrate as set forth in Paragraph 18(b), agreement is hereby given to be bound by the Medical Arbitration Rules of the Florida Medical Associations and the Florida Hospital Associations, as they may be amended from time to time, which rules are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

					<p>
						(f) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Agreement shall be brought by you more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
					</p>
					<p><strong>19.</strong></p>
					<p>Jurisdiction and Choice of Law.</p>
					<p>
						If there is any dispute arising out of the Service, you expressly agree that any such dispute shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this Agreement, then you and United TeleDoc agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within &nbsp;San Francisco County, Florida for the purpose of litigating any dispute, and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue thereof.
					</p>
					<p><strong>20.</strong></p>
					<p>No Third Party Beneficiaries.</p>
					<p>
						You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
